***

Q1: *Describe how you felt and what you remember about the moment this photo was taken. Be honest about whether the image captured your experience, or left something out.*

<!--more--> 
> I remember feeling so free. High school had ended and I didnâ€™t work a lot so I had a lot of free time to hangout with people and go places. There was never a plan we just went with the flow. It was the end of the summer and I was excited for university and the next steps in my life. Being on this empty road in the middle of nowhere **made the world feel so big and made me realize there were so many new experiences waiting for me.**

Q2: *What does it mean to you for this image to be preservedâ€”or any image, in general?*

> I really like this image because I look so happy and I think it truly captures freedom. Iâ€™m running down an empty road with no one in sight. Iâ€™m surrounded by nature. Iâ€™m wearing a loose dress. **Itâ€™s art. Images should be preserved because art should be preserved.** Also itâ€™s used to express emotion and capture specific experiences.

Q3: *If this wasnâ€™t your happiest moment, does the photo still hold a lesson or spark some appreciation for life? Feel free to skip if it doesnâ€™t reflect how you really felt.*

> This makes me appreciate life because I look so happy doing something so simple, like running down a road, and I think that shows that even the **smallest moments can be so meaningful and enjoyable.**

### Photographer Statement
***A described moment, as remembered by Shelley (the photographer).***

This photo was part of a larger photoshoot we intentionally planned â€” outfits and location we're all decided ahead of time. We knew we wanted to capture the beautiful scenery I always mentioned enjoying while driving down that road. For me personally, these moments would serve as a memory of the friendship we had in high school, since it was just a week before we would part ways to attend different universities. I truly felt so much joy while taking these photos, and I wanted to capture the excitement and freedom of new beginningsâ€”even in something as simple as running down an empty road. This run, looking back at what had already been experienced and enjoyed, while moving toward new horizons, aims to capture just that.
