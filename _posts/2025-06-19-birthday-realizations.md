Q1: *Describe how you felt and what you remember about the moment this photo was taken. Be honest about whether the image captured your experience, or left something out.*

<!--more-->
> "It was my birthday, and I felt so giddy. Not to sound selfish or conceited, but I like it when people gather to celebrate me. I feel that now that I've grown up a little bit, I don't really care about the present anymore, but instead I care about simply being with everyone.
>
> This was also the first birthday that I didn't have some of the same people that I had the previous year, however this day I was reminded that I still had a great group of friends and that I wasn‚Äôt completely alone as I‚Äôd felt earlier in the year. Overall, I think this picture captures how happy I was to be turning twenty since it‚Äôs such a big number and a major milestone. The picture just shows how wonderful the day felt, inside and out."

Q2: *What does it mean to you for this image to be preserved‚Äîor any image, in general?*

>‚ÄúI feel like I'm so nostalgic, so when anything is ever captured, I just get so happy looking back at memories because it‚Äôs like, -Wow, my life is so great, and I got to live this experience.- And then when I see the photo, it's like I'm living through it again. So, I feel that it's nice to have a camera capturing your memories.‚Äù 

Q3: *If this wasn‚Äôt your happiest moment, does the photo still hold a lesson or spark some appreciation for life? Feel free to skip if it doesn‚Äôt reflect how you really felt.*

> "I learned to remember to be present and really live your life. On this day, I wasn‚Äôt trying to follow a strict schedule for my birthday, but I still kind of had one on my mind. I remember being really stressed because our place was so far from everyone and no one could find it. I felt bad for the people making such an effort to come. But then you told me, ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs okay. Everyone is here to celebrate you, and they want to see you‚Äîso they‚Äôre happy to take the bus.‚Äù That helped me realize that there‚Äôs no rush and no need to stress‚Äî everything will happen when it needs to. After that, everything felt okay, and I was able to enjoy the moment."

### Photographer Statement
***A described moment, as remembered by Shelley (the photographer).***

Prior to this moment, Emma had been caught up in worries about decorations, whether her friends would make it, and especially if she would still have a good group of people show up after moving out of her previous home and leaving behind some friendships. But in this moment, all I saw was Emma, so happy, looking at the candles glowing before her. A big group of friends sat around her, attentively focusing their care and energy on her as they sang 'Happy Birthday,' celebrating the gratitude they felt for her in their lives. I wanted to capture this moment so Emma would remember that her thoughts aren't always right and to remind her just how deeply loved she truly is.
