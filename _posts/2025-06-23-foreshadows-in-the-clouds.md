Q1: *Describe how you felt and what you remember about the moment this photo was taken. Be honest about whether the image captured your experience, or left something out.*

<!--more-->
> When you first look at this picture, i think the exact same thing. How peaceful. How beautiful. How happy and at home she looks. Which I was. I was surrounded by nature, my people and love. **I think this picture is a perfect representation of the moment I was walking into.** Would you have guessed that though? Probably not because thatâ€™s the whole point of photography. **There is beauty but there is also depth.** There is pain but there is also growth. There is curiosity but there is also certainty. I was feeling all that in this moment. **It was a mix of I feel at peace and the anxieties of the real world waiting for me back in Canada.** I was feeling grateful that my only decision that night was what I wanted off the menu and frustrated that big decisions wait for me back in Canada. **I was surviving my own thunderstorm - because it sure felt like something a forest fire would feel like but the difference is that thereâ€™s always a clear sky after a storm.** There is always beauty in the hard moments. Especially the ones that feel like a forest fire.

Q2: *What does it mean to you for this image to be preservedâ€”or any image, in general?*

> I think photography is such a beautiful form of expression. Although just like my opinion with books and movies - the book will always be better. So will the moment. **Nothing will ever beat that exact moment that is captured. But photography gives us the gift or reliving it whenever we please.** Weâ€™re able to look at past moments and tell - enhance our stories with the moment captured by someone who understood the importance of that moment. Photography captures emotions, the thoughts - seconds before a next move. To me - **for an image to be preserved also means a story only few can tell.**

Q3: *If this wasnâ€™t your happiest moment, does the photo still hold a lesson or spark some appreciation for life? Feel free to skip if it doesnâ€™t reflect how you really felt.*

> I absolutely love the picture in general. I love it because it truly captures me in a place I imagine and call my safe place. I love the way it foreshadows whatâ€™s to come. **Iâ€™m in grounding position and the place I was entering taught me how to ground myself. How to be present. How to breathe and let go.** How to fill my own bucket before filling others. Everything you see in the image is what I was about to learn and emerge myself into.

### Photographer Statement
***A described moment, as remembered by Shelley (the photographer).***

Prior to this picture being captured, I was both overwhelmed and fascinated by the vastness of the clouds that were closely surrounding us. It was so cloudy that you couldnâ€™t see past a kilometer. All I could see was whiteness everywhere, but because there wasnâ€™t much to focus on, I could truly see what was right in front of me in the current moment. I saw my sister sharing that same observation of the beautiful nature around us, so I asked her to sit down. Once she sat, I no longer saw bland white expanses of cloudsâ€”my attention was stolen by the beauty encountered right in the middle of it. My sister seemed so at peace in that moment, still and absorbing what the environment was providing, so I tried to capture that.
