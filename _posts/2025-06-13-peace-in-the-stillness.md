Q1: *Describe how you felt and what you remember about the moment this photo was taken. Be honest about whether the image captured your experience, or left something out.*

<!--more-->

> I see my authentic Self in this photo. **In that moment, I felt connected, unjudged, and completely present.** We were in front of a beautiful lake that I would pass by on my commute to work every day. Thanks to Shelley (the photographer) I finally took the time to get out of my car and admire the lake fully. We stopped by with the intention of taking photos but the whole experience felt unposed and natural. **We were both present with eachother and the nature around us.** I felt whole when this photo was captured, and now it reflects my beauty back at me.

Q2: *What does it mean to you for this image to be preservedâ€”or any image, in general?*

> I think an image being preserved means an image being valued and looked back on. We now can take hundreds of photos a day and itâ€™s easy for them to get lost in a large camera roll. To me, **a preserved image means one that is taken and viewed intentionally**, whether itâ€™s printed or digital or in a memory. The photo serves a purpose more than just being taken.

Q3: *If this wasnâ€™t your happiest moment, does the photo still hold a lesson or spark some appreciation for life? Feel free to skip if it doesnâ€™t reflect how you really felt.*

> I spend most my time trying to reach that state of presence, connection and peace that I was feeling in this photo. **But usually, I try too hard and worry so much that I do the opposite.** My pursuit of happiness can bring me stress. **Looking at that photo reminded me that moments like that occur when youâ€™re not trying.** They occur when you just exist. When you decide to accept and appreciate the moment youâ€™re in, even if itâ€™s difficult or not where you want to be. If you view peace as something to attain, it wonâ€™t be where you are. Youâ€™ll miss the special moments while youâ€™re busy looking into the distance.

        <td>Buse, seated near the edge of the grass that encircles the small lake, rests her back against the wooden markers that outline where cars and people are not meant to enter. Her hair is fanned out by the wind streaming past her face as she looks over her shoulder, gazing toward the road where cars occasionally pass along the otherwise quiet, rural stretch.

### Photographer Statement
***A described moment, as remembered by Shelley (the photographer).***

I was excited that Buse had invited me to see a spot she discovered during one of her drives. Before I even took out my camera, we spent some time quietly observing the beauty of this place. The lake was extremely still, and the sun shone brightly, creating the illusion of sparkles glittering across the water. The tree branches draped down gently, their leaves swaying slowly in the breeze.

We spent time catching upâ€”talking about what had been happening in our lives and the internal monologues weâ€™d been having with ourselves. As she spoke, I pulled out my camera to record and capture shots of her interacting with the environmentâ€”touching the grass, gazing toward the lake, fidgeting with some flowers, and watching the cars that occasionally passed by. It was incredibly quiet, except for the distant echoes of people across the lake at the beach in Valens Park Conservation Area. This moment felt so precious to me: to have our attention fully on the beauty around us, while also offering a listening ear to one anotherâ€”and simply sharing moments of silence together. I would say we were in different places in our lives, yet we were able to share each otherâ€™s unique perspectives and experiencesâ€”and truly appreciate those differences.
