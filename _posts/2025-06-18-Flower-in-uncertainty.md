Q1: *Describe how you felt and what you remember about the moment this photo was taken. Be honest about whether the image captured your experience, or left something out.*

> This photo is amazing. As I was walking down the aisle of flowers with her in the bright sun I knew how beautiful and gorgeous she was. **You could see a sparkle in her eyes, the slight smirk she had all day from the pretty flowers, just how happy she was in the moment you could feel it yourself.** One of her favourite acts of love is when I brush her cheek with my thumb, you can see just how loved and appreciated she feels from this little act of love.

Q2: *What does it mean to you for this image to be preservedâ€”or any image, in general?*

> This means everything to me. Any photo, good or bad, with her is so important to me. **I love capturing our relationship as it unfolds in the moment**, looking back on the photos, and reliving the beautiful memories and lessons we have learned as a couple. I cherish them.

Q3: *If this wasnâ€™t your happiest moment, does the photo still hold a lesson or spark some appreciation for life? Feel free to skip if it doesnâ€™t reflect how you really felt.*

> This photo was taken during a stressful point in my life. I had a few interviews with jobs that would cause me to move thousands of miles away from home to start my career. **All the while she was by my side encouraging me to grab an opportunity once I had the chance to.** The beauty of Ashley is so deep on every single layer, sheâ€™s gorgeous, sheâ€™s kind, her heart and empathy for others is astounding, she keeps me grounded. I have never a met a more beautiful soul than Ashley and I know for a fact that I will do everything in my power to make her as happy as possible.

### Photographer Statement
***A described moment, as remembered by Shelley (the photographer).***

My sister, her boyfriend Jake, my friend Victoria, and I had visited the tulip farm festival. I had been taking pictures of my friend in the field, but when we ran into my sister and Jake, I immediately knew I had to photograph them. Their love has always been so visibly clearâ€”through the way they smile at each other and care for one anotherâ€”so I wanted to capture just how sweet and gentle their interactions were. Having them in the center of the tulip field, yet completely focused on each other, was such a beautiful sight. I wanted to share the love they radiated for one another, so others could see itâ€”and smile too. Their love was so intense, I could feel it just by taking the photos. I wonder if you can see it through this image.
