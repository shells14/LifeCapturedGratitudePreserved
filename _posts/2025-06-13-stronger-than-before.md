==**Subject in image and reflections shared by: Ashley Salinas** ==

***

Q1: *Describe how you felt and what you remember about the moment this photo was taken. Be honest about whether the image captured your experience, or left something out.*

**After asking Ashley the previous question, she realized she didn‚Äôt remember when this picture was taken. So, after I mentioned that this was taken in Vancouver, BC, during a hiking trail with our family, she began to recall this moment and what ideas this image sparked within her.**

<!--more-->

> ‚ÄúI honestly really like this image because it reminds me of a moment when I first began to realize that I was getting stronger‚Äîlike, physical-wise. I remember the sweater that I was wearing because I recall being happy in it after sweating so much. This wasn‚Äôt necessarily captured in the picture, but prior to this photo being taken, **I was beating you guys all the way up the hiking trail without getting tired**, like I used to on previous trips with the family. So that‚Äôs why I like this moment‚Äîbecause it was the first time I actually enjoyed hiking without complaining. **I saw how much stronger my body was becoming**. ‚Äú 

Q2: *What does it mean to you for this image to be preserved‚Äîor any image, in general?*

> ‚ÄúI used to think that images weren‚Äôt important to capture, that it was better to just be in the moment. But I‚Äôve actually started taking a lot more pictures recently, and **I actually like looking back on them‚Äîbecause sometimes, you know, your memory isn't the best.** So it‚Äôs good to have pictures to help with a little memory recall, like I just had."

Q3: *If this wasn‚Äôt your happiest moment, does the photo still hold a lesson or spark some appreciation for life? Feel free to skip if it doesn‚Äôt reflect how you really felt.*

> ‚ÄúBy having this image captured, it helped me appreciate my body a lot more. By looking at this image, I can just see how cozy this moment was, with the sun shining down on you and all. But overall, this image captured a moment when I realized that **the hard work I was putting into my physical health and training was paying off.**‚Äù 


A beautiful walk in Vancounver, British Columbia. As the day was coming to an end, a family of 6 decided to go on a walk along the water trails. They saw the sunset, and the golden light that shone out of it landed beautifully on all those who stared at it.

### Photographer Statement
***A described moment, as remembered by Shelley (the photographer).***

As Ashley mentioned, this picture was taken after a long day of hiking trails surrounding the city of Vancouver. We spent the entire day doing nothing more than simply moving our bodies while admiring the beautiful trees, lakes, and bodies of water all around us. It was especially nice to enjoy that time as a family and to help my aunt, who was visiting from Mexico, experience the unique beauty that Canada has to offer. This moment in particular felt like a moment of rest for me. After being in the sun and moving all day, it was a time to pause, observe the people around us, and take in the stunning colors of the sky as they merged into one. I took pictures of my sisters here so they could also be swept up in the beauty of nature and be reminded of the incredible sights they saw‚Äîbecause truly, this one was intensely astonishing and almost unreal. The picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice.
