Hi, I’m Shelley Salinas, the developer of this website, which holds many of the photographs I’ve taken over the last eight years. My passion for videography and photography is rooted in a deep fascination with the power of images to communicate meaning beyond words. As an observant individual, I would document my life by capturing images of my loved ones or beautiful scenery that I encountered, **hoping to share the beauty I saw in the world so others could also partake in the joy I was experiencing.** 

Later, when I began traveling with my family, I continued to take photos of funny moments, significant locations, and vlog-style clips from our trips. My sisters and I would rewatch them—either for a laugh or to relive and reflect on everything we had seen. Since then, I’ve created some experimental short films that reflect personal life lessons. These videos have become an emotional outlet for me—a way to express what I’m feeling and later look back to remember that I overcame those moments. They often leave me with encouragement, helping me carry forward the lessons learned from each season of life.


These days, I carry my camera with me on any adventure or time spent with friends and family, ready to capture moments in their lives, and record memories I might have otherwise forgotten during these busy, pivotal and transformative early adulthood years. I’m also known by my family and friends to have a bad memory, yet I can remember exactly everything that happened before, during, and after a picture I took. Photos are my way of using visual cues to recall and not forget precious moments in life, helping me appreciate experiences that may not have been acknowledged at the time.
