<!--# About the Project (alraedy used) -->

This website is a collaborative effort, inviting people featured in the photos to reflect on the meaning associated with the images, or offer internal insight into that moment. Their reflections appear alongside mine, offering a layered perspective of a single moment. 

> My aim for this project is that even in a large-scale global archive, each photograph still functions as part of an individual story. While photos may appear visually similar, each one carries a unique emotional and narrative weight. This helps us see the differences in lived experiences as part of a multi-narrative archive, rather than a single, uniform one.

<!--image to divide up the text content-->

Inspired by readings in my Culture and Technology Studies summer workshop course (CTS3030), I attempt to show how photographs work as tools for memory-making and shaping reality—and how history is framed differently depending on how both the individual and the photographer view what’s valuable in a moment. 

> Participant reflections are submitted through digital forms or in-person interviews. Text is only edited for grammar, and permission is always asked before posting names or images.

This project tends to take on a positive framing, with the **goal of helping people foster appreciation for life by remembering good things or lessons taken from a moment—even in difficult or trying seasons.** However, asking people to reframe their memories might not fully capture the complexity of their experiences. So, their first reflection on the memory is posted as-is, followed by any lessons or insights they chose to share in response to the final reflective prompt.
